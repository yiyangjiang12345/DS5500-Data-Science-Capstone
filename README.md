# Title: Sentiment-Driven Game Discovery Engine for Steam

## Authors
Yiyang Jiang

## Abstract
This project aims to analyze Steam game reviews to develop better recommendation systems and perform sentiment analysis. The project utilizes a dataset containing details about user reviews, game ownership, and playtime statistics. Using machine learning models, including a hybrid recommendation system and a sentiment analysis model based on BERT, I have developed tools that can enhance the gaming experience by tailoring game suggestions to user preferences and analyzing the sentiment of user reviews.

## Introduction
The project investigates the effectiveness of different recommendation systems and sentiment analysis techniques applied to Steam game reviews. Steam's extensive user base and rich metadata offer a unique opportunity for such analyses. Previous works have utilized similar datasets but often focused solely on either recommendation systems or sentiment analysis. Our project integrates both to provide comprehensive insights and improvements over existing methods.

## Methods
The project employs several data processing and machine learning techniques:

- Data Collection: Collected and cleaned Steam review data, focusing on user interactions and preferences.
- ecommendation System: Implemented user-user and hybrid recommendation models.
- Sentiment Analysis: Utilized a BERT-based model to analyze and score sentiment from user reviews, adjusting for nuances in gaming language.

## Experimental Results (Evaluation)
- The recommendation system was tested for accuracy and diversity in suggestions, showing promising results in aligning user preferences with game recommendations.
- The sentiment analysis model achieved an 88% accuracy rate, with balanced performance across different sentiment categories. This demonstrates its effectiveness in understanding and categorizing user sentiment accurately.

## Discussion (Analysis)
The results indicate significant potential for enhancing user engagement through tailored recommendations and understanding user sentiment, which can aid developers in improving game design and marketing strategies. Future work could explore integrating these models more closely with real-time data feeds to adapt recommendations dynamically.

## Statement of Contributions
- Yiyang Jiang: Led the data collection and preprocessing efforts.
- Yiyang Jiang: Developed the recommendation algorithms.
- Yiyang Jiang: Implemented and tuned the sentiment analysis model.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the feasibility and value of applying advanced machine learning techniques to enhance user experience and developer insights in the gaming industry, specifically through the Steam platform.
