# Recommendation System

## Overview
This folder contains the code and resources for developing and testing various recommendation systems as part of the capstone project.

## Contents
- `.gitkeep`: A placeholder file.
- Multiple Jupyter notebooks detailing different approaches to recommendation systems:
  - `User-user & hybrid.ipynb`: Implements user-user collaborative filtering and hybrid methods.
  - `content-based filtering.ipynb`: Implements content-based filtering methods.
- Python scripts and images related to the interface of the recommendation system:
  - `diversity score.png`: Image showing the diversity score calculation.
  - `diversity_novelty2.py`: Python script for calculating diversity and novelty.
  - `interface_streamlit_v3.py`: Streamlit script for the web-based interface of the recommendation system.
  - `recommendation_interface.py`: Backend script for generating recommendations.
  - Images of the interface (`screenshots of the interface.png`, `streamlit_gpt1.png`, `streamlit_gpt2.png`).

## Usage
Refer to each Jupyter notebook for specific usage instructions. Run the Streamlit script `interface_streamlit_v3.py` to start the web interface locally.

## Contributing
Please refer to the main project's contribution guidelines for submitting improvements or extensions to the recommendation algorithms.
